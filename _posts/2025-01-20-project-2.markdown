project-date: December 2024
client: Just for kicks...
category: Game Solver Development
description: In this project, we develop a customized interior point algorithm for solving mixed complementarity problems. This is a broad class of mathematical programming problems that includes Nash equilibrium problems. Our solver achieves state-of-the-art performance, and also supports automatic differentiation of solutions with respect to problem parameters. This way, you can use <i>MixedComplementarityProblems.jl</i> within larger machine learning pipelines! This project is under active development, so stay tuned for more updates! <br><a href="https://github.com/CLeARoboticsLab/MixedComplementarityProblems.jl">[code]</a>
